PROJECT NAME
The World Problems Index
DESCRIPTION
Pitch: There are a lot of problems in the world, some technical, some global, some very human. All of them have some level of interconnectedness with other problems. We should create an index of these problems so that we can visualize a problem and its related problems on which it's being solved is conditional. In doing so, we'll have a better mental model of the world and some people may find inspiration in looking for problems to solve—seeing what the world would look like if they were eliminated.

We humans aren't particularly good at constructing coherent and detailed mental models of the entire world. I'm hoping my project will help remedy this.

MVP Feature List:
• Problem Model (Django) — Description, Field, related_Problems (Completed; needs refinement)
• Field Model (Completed; needs refinement)
• Web app for exploring these relationships (think Wikipedia at min level of complexity) (Completed; needs refinement)

Stretch
• Amazing visualizations that help us to see non-obvious patterns in the data
• Visualizations with "backlinks" to see how many times a certain problem is referenced by other problems
• Visualizations minus a certain problem and problems which would be eliminated upon elimination of the "parent" problem

*** I started building this a few months ago, but stopped because I was too busy to continue. I have a good starting point for others to build off of, regardless. ***
