# Proposal

---

- What problem does your app solve?

Everyone wants to help! Deep down we all want to the world to be a better place. The main reason most of us use the #prayfor hashtag and then move on to new things whenever there is a tragedy or natural disaster is not because we are hypocrites or apathetic; for most of us, this is the best we can do. 

Information overload and misinformation makes it extremely difficult for us to really understand the  nature and gravity of crisis happening in other parts of the world. A lack of clear detailed metrics on what problem needs to be addressed first, Information asymmetry caused by agents who look to profit from chaos among many other reasons, makes it really hard for people to be able to know the actual problems our world face and to also be able to fix them.

- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?

An appealing, simple and responsive website indexing the problems of the world will help;

- create and increase awareness on the problems the world face
- create an accessible mental model of world problems and how they are interconnected
- facilitate the finding of solutions to these problems.
- serve as an inspirational tool for idealists, humanists and entrepreneurs.

- What is the mission statement?

# Features

---

- What features are required for your minimum viable product?

A web app that explores the relations between problems, and how these problems are interconnected as well as their respective solutions.

The web app should be able to clearly depict what these problems are via visual aids, and what the world will look like if any of these issues are solved.

- What features may you wish to put in a future release?

An interactive data visualizer that uses data scraping and other innovative data analysis tools to  help educate the user.

A donation/pledge button that collect donations to help fund our already declared humanitarian projects.

- What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?

informs them on the gravity of the problem using metrics.

educates them and redirects them to resources that will help them the issues on a deeper level.

allows them to contribute to helping solve the issues through donations.

# Frameworks - Libraries

---

- What 3rd party frameworks/libraries are you considering using?

- Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access?

- Are you required to pay to use the API?

- Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?)

# For Data Scientists

---

- Describe the Established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day 1.

- You can gather information about the data set you’ll be working with from the project description. Be sure to collaborate with your PM, and your Backend Architect to chat about the resources you have.

- Write a description for what the DS problem is (what uncertainty/prediction are we trying to do here? Sentiment analysis? Why is this a useful solution to a problem?)

- A target (e.g. JSON format or such) for output that DS students can deliver to web/other students for them to ingest and use in the app

# Target Audience

---

- Who is your target audience? Be specific.

- Idealists.
- Humanists.
- Non-for-Profit Organisations.
- Entrepreneurs.
- Venture Capitalists and Risk Tolerant Investors.

- What feedback have you gotten from potential users?

- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?

Research

---

- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.

# Prototype Key Feature(s)

---

- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
